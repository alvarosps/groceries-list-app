*Groceries List App, by alvarosps*

* How to run:

- I tried to implement docker to run the project, but due to the time i couldn't test much. The mongodb part doesn't need a container, because it's on MongoDB Atlas Cluster.

- If 'docker-compose build' doesn't work, please follow the steps:

- - cd server; npm install; npm start; (in 1 terminal)
- - cd client; npm install; npm start; (in a 2nd terminal)

The application should open at localhost:3000 , already with database access.
* *Notes*:
* Because of MongoDB Atlas Cluster restrictions, please email me at alvaro123sps@gmail.com with your IP address, so I can add to the Cluster Allowed IPs.
